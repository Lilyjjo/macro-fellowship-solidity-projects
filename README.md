## MacroDAO Project Repo

This repo contains the completed course work for Macro's solidity bootcamp, all completed by hand from scratch.
Completed May-July 2022 by Lily Johnson.

The projects include:
- Crowdfund: a crowdfund project rewarding contributors with NFTs
- ICO: a 3 tiered ICO 
- DAO: a DAO with generic code execution abilities, specialized logic for buying NFTs, and a 1:1 voting system
- LP: a uniswap-v2 like liquidity pool for the token created in the ICO project

All projects were audited by the Macro Auditing team and teaching staff. Audits for the original submissions can be found unchanged in each folder in the `staff-audit-XXX.md` file.
